# What This Repo Is

This repository now centers on a **browser-native World3 experience**:

- a static web app in `app/static/`
- a shared TypeScript simulation core used by both the web UI and CLI
- CI visual validation that renders the BAU chart from that same TS core

The main product path is now:

1. static site
2. shared TS simulation engine

World3 models the long-term interaction of:

- population
- industrial capital
- agriculture and food
- pollution
- nonrenewable resources

This fork is focused on making that model explorable, testable, and deployable in modern browser and CI environments.

# Quick Start

## Web App

Run the static app locally:

```bash
cd app/static
npm ci
npm run build
npm run serve -- --port 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## TypeScript Checks

```bash
cd app/static
npm run typecheck
npm run test:coverage
```

## End-to-End UI

```bash
cd app/static
npx playwright install chromium
npm run test:e2e
```

# GitHub Pages

The static app is deployed through GitHub Pages using `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.

The site is built from `app/static/` and is safe to serve under the repository subpath:

`https://serroba.github.io/world3/`

# Cloudflare

The repo also includes a root [wrangler.jsonc](./wrangler.jsonc) so Cloudflare can deploy the app as static assets directly from:

`app/static/`

That means the current browser app does not require a server runtime on Cloudflare either; it can be published as an assets-only Worker deployment.

# CLI

The browser-native CLI uses the same TS core as the web app.

Example:

```bash
cd app/static
npm run build
npm run browser-native:cli -- --summary
npm run browser-native:cli -- --plot-svg /tmp/world3.svg
```

This is the path used by CI to generate the simulation summary and chart preview in pull requests.

# Project Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/static/ts/core/` | Shared World3 engine, sector logic, runtime graph, calibration and validation logic |
| `app/static/ts/cli/` | Node-facing adapters for the TS core |
| `app/static/js/` | Generated browser/runtime JS assets |
| `app/static/data/` | Static lookup tables, parity fixtures, and OWID-derived local data |
| `app/static/test/` | Unit and end-to-end coverage for the static app and core |

# Architecture

The current architecture has three layers:

## 1. Shared TS Core

Pure TypeScript modules implement:

- runtime primitives
- execution graph planning
- sector logic
- calibration and validation logic
- artifact generation for summaries and plots

This core is designed to be usable from both browser and CLI adapters and could be extracted into a publishable npm package later.

## 2. Browser Adapter

The static web app consumes the shared core via lightweight browser-facing modules. It loads tables and bundled reference data as static assets and runs locally in the browser.

## 3. CLI Adapter

The TS CLI consumes the same shared core to generate summaries and SVG plots in CI and local workflows.
