# What This Repo Is

This repository now centers on a **browser-native World3 experience**:

- a static web app in `app/static/`
- a shared TypeScript simulation core used by both the web UI and CLI
- CI visual validation that renders the BAU chart from that same TS core

The goal is no longer “serve a Python app with a browser attached.” The main product path is now:

1. static site
2. shared TS simulation engine
3. optional legacy Python reference implementation kept in-repo for compatibility and historical traceability

World3 models the long-term interaction of:

- population
- industrial capital
- agriculture and food
- pollution
- nonrenewable resources

This fork is focused on making that model explorable, testable, and deployable in modern browser and CI environments.

# Quick Start

## Web App

Run the static app locally:

```bash
cd app/static
npm ci
npm run build
npm run serve -- --port 8000
```

Then open `http://localhost:8000`.

## TypeScript Checks

```bash
cd app/static
npm run typecheck
npm run test:coverage
```

## End-to-End UI

```bash
.venv/bin/python -m pytest tests/e2e/test_ui.py -q --no-cov
```

# GitHub Pages

The static app is deployed through GitHub Pages using `.github/workflows/deploy-pages.yml`.

The site is built from `app/static/` and is safe to serve under the repository subpath:

`https://serroba.github.io/world3/`

# CLI

The browser-native CLI uses the same TS core as the web app.

Example:

```bash
cd app/static
npm run build
npm run browser-native:cli -- --summary
npm run browser-native:cli -- --plot-svg /tmp/world3.svg
```

This is the path used by CI to generate the simulation summary and chart preview in pull requests.

# Project Layout

| Path | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `app/static/ts/core/` | Shared World3 engine, sector logic, runtime graph, calibration and validation logic |
| `app/static/ts/cli/` | Node-facing adapters for the TS core |
| `app/static/js/` | Generated browser/runtime JS assets |
| `app/static/data/` | Static lookup tables, parity fixtures, and OWID-derived local data |
| `tests/e2e/` | Browser end-to-end coverage for the static app |
| `pyworld3/` | Legacy Python implementation and compatibility surfaces |

# Legacy Python Reference

The Python code is no longer required for:

- serving the frontend
- local simulation
- local compare
- local calibration logic
- local validation logic
- PR simulation visualization

It remains in the repo as a **reference implementation** and for compatibility with the earlier project shape. That makes it useful for historical comparison, parity work, and gradual decommissioning, but it is no longer the primary execution path for the product.

# Architecture

The current architecture has three layers:

## 1. Shared TS Core

Pure TypeScript modules implement:

- runtime primitives
- execution graph planning
- sector logic
- calibration and validation logic
- artifact generation for summaries and plots

This core is designed to be usable from both browser and CLI adapters and could be extracted into a publishable npm package later.

## 2. Browser Adapter

The static web app consumes the shared core via lightweight browser-facing modules. It loads tables and bundled reference data as static assets and runs locally in the browser.

## 3. CLI Adapter

The TS CLI consumes the same shared core to generate summaries and SVG plots in CI and local workflows.
